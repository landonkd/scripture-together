			remarks: '<p>What is the nature of the world we inhabit today? Is it fundamentally good, in need of renewal? Or is it fundamentally broken, in need of replacement? What do you see when you look at the world?</p><p>The rabbis talk at great length about the principles of ayin tovah and ayin ra’ah — the “good eye” and the “bad eye.” If one has a good eye, they see the world in light of its potential goodness and possibility; they have a belief that goodness and light is driving the direction of our experience. Conversely, if one has a bad eye, they see the world through the lens of scarcity and potential disaster; they have a fear that darkness and depravity is going to screw up the story.</p><p>How do we develop one kind of eyesight or the other? By the stories we listen to. Different stories shape the eyes we see with, and how we engage with those stories is deeply important.</p><p>On the one hand, there is this dominant narrative that has popped up in different forms throughout the ages: an essential belief in cosmic conflict. The belief that underneath it all, there is a fundamental problem. And unless that problem is solved, we are all doomed. Defeated. Cursed. Condemned.</p><p>At times in history, this narrative appeared in the form of polytheism. The gods were in a great cosmic war and the facts of our earthly creation and experience were the byproducts of their battles. We experienced strife and destruction because these were the forces that shaped the created world itself. Your best chance for a positive outcome was to fool or manipulate the gods to arrange the cosmic pieces in your favor.</p><p>This story has shown up in different forms since then: nihilism, imperialism, colonialism, tribalism. It has even made a sophisticated and systematic appearance in the world of Christian theology and faith — the belief that all creation is fundamentally broken and our sinful depravity is the fundamental truth of our existence.</p><p>Now, there is certainly no denying the deep and profound ways in which we experience struggle and darkness in our world. Without a doubt, there are massive problems and incredible brokenness in our world. Sin is a real danger on personal, relational, corporate, social, and systemic levels. There can be no reasonable perspective that denies the reality and impact of disaster in our lives. But is that all? Is that the essence of this world and the people in it?</p><p>Because on the other hand, there is an alternative narrative in Hebrew scriptures — the story of God — set out in the first pages to undo this misconception of doom and defeat, insisting instead that, in the midst of the brokenness, there is wholeness. Even in a world coated with badness, if you were to scrape it away you would find goodness underneath. The basalt-ridden landscape surrounding a volcano is indeed hard, cracked, lifeless, and black. But that is only the surface of things. The underlying reality is that the vast majority of the mass of this planet is actually brilliant, pulsing hot, life-giving, radiant magma. In spite of massive darkness, there is light; in spite of pervasive death, there is life. And, crucially, this alternative narrative insists that, far from being some far-off, optimistic hope of the future, this has always been and continues to be the world’s fundamental truth. This is where it all began and this is where it begins for us.</p><p>This narrative invites us to be people of ayin tovah.</p><p>Before it ever gets to acknowledging the badness and the brokenness of the world (which it certainly does), this story insists on teaching us a very important lesson, one that we skip over at our peril: The world God made and the world that still endures is blessed and good. Very good, even. The danger of moving on before we learn this lesson is immense. We invite the possibility of being focused on the problems so much that we end up redefining our fundamental existence by them. This is undoubtedly what much of our Christian theology has done. With a slight nod to the goodness of creation and an acknowledgement of the authority of the Creator, we race ahead to the next story, start our lesson a couple chapters later than we ought to, and begin with the wrong perspective: that of ayin ra’ah.</p><p>Before we meet Adam and Eve, before we take a stroll in the garden, we are invited to learn a very important practice — the practice of trusting this story of goodness.</p><p>How does this narrative suggest we learn it? Well, it will not be done quickly or easily. It will come through retraining our spiritual assumptions and our neural pathways. If we commit ourselves to the faithfulness of Sabbath, to the practice of rest, we will learn how to start believing in a better story that will have the potential to redefine everything in our experience.</p><p>This practice is both a reminder and subversive act. It is a reminder of what is most true about our world, no matter what our experience tries to tell us. It is a reminder that goodness, life, potential, possibility, love, acceptance, and grace lie at the heart of creation. They are the native species of this world. It is a reminder that death, disease, cancer, selfishness, greed, exclusion, and injustice are an invasive species — intruders that must be done away with.</p><p>And it is an act of subversion against this pervasive motif of darkness that seeks to define our worth, set our pace, and demand our attention. It is a willful act of setting our gaze on what we believe to be true, what we trust in God’s story, over and against what we fear and what we feel.</p><p>Trusting in the goodness. Resting in the trust. Entering the rest.</p>',

			remarks: '<p>What makes a human a human? We often ask this question as scientists, debating our relationship with the chain of evolution. We ask it as philosophers, wondering about the purpose and meaning of our lives. But today we ask it as a reflection on this ancient story of human origins in Genesis, trying to think like an eastern listener. And as we do, the question shifts from “What makes us human?” to “What does it mean to be made in the image of God?”</p><p>A good place to start is with what we have heard about God so far in the story. What have we learned? Last week, we saw he is a God who values and models (and later commands) rest. He himself creates in each of the six days, separating and filling, but only to a point. Then he lets creation take over: “Let them produce after their own kind.” And even then, only to a point. Creative activity stops on the seventh day to make time and space for holy rest.</p><p>The rabbis teach that one of the names for God, “El Shaddai,” is actually something quite interesting. Often translated “God Almighty,” the name is most literally translated “God of the Breasts,” a very common name for ancient pagan goddesses of fertility. Thinking there must be a better option, the sages and rabbis noted that the consonants could form a shorthand Hebrew phrase; Hebrew lacks vowels, so the arrangements of how someone breaks up the consonants (especially in proper nouns) can change the translation. In this teaching, the combination of consonants create a Hebrew phrase which says, “The God Who Knows When to Say Enough.” This is the God character we meet in these stories about origins, is it not? A God who knows when to stop creating (“sabbath” literally means cease). A God who knows how to stop a hand of vengeance. A God who knows when to stop destroying. A God who knows when to stop blessing.</p><p>If this ceasing is one of the qualities at the very heart of God’s character, it may have something to do with what it means to be made in his image. We’ll ask it again: “What does it mean to be made in the image of God?”</p><p>Some of our common answers actually follow an older Talmudic line of thought, starting with physical form, moving toward mental ability, and then on to relational capacity.</p><p>Is it our bodies that set us apart? In the age of neuroscience, some point to the human brain as the thing that distinguishes us above other creatures. But in the story, the serpent may well be walking upright, according to Jewish tradition. One midrash points out that it’s not until after the curse that he is sent upon his belly, implying legs before, and another even talks about the serpent shaking the tree with his hands when Eve (incorrectly) told him that God told her that she would die if she even touched the fruit. The point is, when it comes to anatomy, lines are blurred between man and beast in this story.</p><p>Is it our ability to reason logically and abstractly that makes us unique? Not in Genesis, apparently. The crafty beast is quite crafty indeed, engaging Eve in a cunning discussion with logic and reasoning. That he can speak at all is a sign of immense intellect and reason. It’s another instance in which humans aren’t as unique as we thought.</p><p>What about our ability to relate and have relationships with one another? It’s another no at this point. The serpent beast again appears to have these same capacities when he talks to Eve and appeals to her desire. Jewish midrash teaches that the serpent’s manipulation was actually an attempt to usurp Adam’s role and produce offspring with Eve.</p><p>We are told that the defining mark of mankind in all of the Creator’s creation is their being a bearer of the Divine reflection, but what is the essence of this unique reflection? None of these qualities seem to suffice as an answer when we look closely at the Text, but there is one other path to explore.</p><p>The rabbis teach that the clue we need is found in the nature of the temptation itself. The one new detail that emerges in Eve’s interaction with the serpent seems to be the preoccupation with desire. What is the serpent’s ultimate temptation? Is it not the idea that Eve is to pursue her desires, insinuating God would not have given her these desires if he did not mean for her to act on them? The serpent says, “Did God really say that?” One rabbi I learned from said that the Hebrew reader does not hear a serpent trying to make Eve doubt her recollection, but a statement of incredulity, putting the emphasis on say. “Did God really say that? Obviously, he can’t mean that. I mean, just look at it!”</p><p>Here we come full circle to reflections on a God who knows when to say “enough.” What sets him apart in his creative work is the very thing intended to mark the difference between humans and beasts. A beast, outside of being trained, will never work against their own instinctual desires. When an animal is hungry, it eats. When it is mating season, the animal mates. A beast is incapable of practicing self-restraint as an act of will.</p><p>But we can. And we are invited to, for that is what God wanted for Adam and Eve. She was given the chance to obey and demonstrate that her desire was not all-powerful, and so are we.</p><p>We are invited to know when to stop indulging, destroying, and serving our own self-interest. In last week’s passage, we were invited to know when to say enough to our labor and our work. In this week’s passage, we are invited to know when to say enough to our desire. We truly are meant to know when to say enough — when to stop striving for love and value and acceptance and significance.</p><p>One of the most important things we all have to do is to know when to say enough to the voices inside our heads telling us we aren’t enough — smart enough or committed enough or good enough or successful enough or beautiful enough. If we don’t learn to identify those voices as the lies they are, we are going to act out of those places of insecurity to destructive consequences, something we will see next week.</p><p>This story is not a tale about how sin entered the world. This story is a tale about why we sin in the first place. More important than whether the story happened is that the story happens every day. It is a warning for what happens when we don’t trust the story and find a place of rest that tells us the truth. We are deceived into an obsession with our own frailty and humanity — our nakedness — the very nakedness that was beautiful when the story began.</p>'

			remarks: '<p>What is the greatest danger in not trusting the story? We have been talking about the invitation to trust that God does accept us and love us, and that our primary essence was conceived in goodness and exists in goodness. We spoke of how this trust enables us to act out of the qualities that reflect the Divine image. We know when to say enough to our desires for self-indulgence, and we explored when to say enough to the internal monologues that are rooted in fear and insecurity.</p><p>Why is this so important? Because if we let fear and insecurity reign in our daily experience, we will act out of that fear — just as beasts. We will fight to protect ourselves as an act of survival or even of vengeance. If we believe we lack, and that such lack affects our ability to thrive, we will attempt to take what we lack from others.</p><p>Sometimes we will take this through robbery, stealing from others the spiritual capital of which we fear we are short. What spiritual capital is important in the Kingdom economy? Mercy, value, acceptance, right-standing, the fruits of the Spirit, a purpose for being, a walk of meaningful righteousness; if we feel as though we lack these things, we will try to acquire that value by taking it from others. (By the way, acquire is the meaning of Cain’s name in today’s story.) Sometimes we will attempt to remove the threat to our lack, seeing other people and circumstances as a menace that drains our own value.</p><p>We see this in the story of Cain where he initiates a gift to God. (It was his idea!) After a long, hard day’s work, he decides to give some of his hard-earned bounty to God. It appears that Abel jumped in on the idea and tried to up the ante of the gift. We are told God looks favorably on Abel’s gift, but not Cain’s. We are not told the backstory, though the rabbis suggest Cain’s gift was one given out of a sense of duty to be grateful, while Abel took Cain’s idea and leaned more into the heart of giving.</p><p>Cain immediately feels the threat. His insecurity tells him that someone else’s success is a sure indication of his own declining value. However, God confronts this thinking and begs Cain to reconsider the myriad other ways he can view the situation. He invites Cain to “master the beast” crouching at his door, to know that it is time to say “Enough!” to his insecurity, warning him that if he doesn’t, it could have disastrous consequences.</p><p>But he doesn’t. And so it does.</p><p>To finish out this week’s reflection, here is Josh Bossé, a campus minister, BEMA co-host, and friend of mine, who wrote the following about this conversation and these consequences.</p><blockquote><p>And finally, God tells Cain that sin crouches at the door, and then quotes word for word the reminder to Adam that he could not have mastery over anything unless he had a partner. On one level, God is getting at the heart of Cain’s struggle: his name-appropriate jealousy, his passion. He’s telling Cain the thing he is really mad about is that it is hard to live with people, it is hard to understand them, and it is hard to reconcile with them, especially when they seem like obstacles, enemies, and problems. But He then tells Cain it is the struggle itself which is essential to his own abundance, that without this tension in his midst, he would be nothing but an animal. There’s no moving forward in the garden. “Yes, Cain, life is hard; it’s hard to do work, it’s even harder to do good, but in that tension is a Good Story which I invite you into!”</p><p>Now the door phrase makes sense. Doors are in houses. God talks to Cain while he is in a house and tells him, “If you walk out that door, into the field, you will sin. Please don’t go.” Here we see the first use of the word “sin,” which I think indicates God was also revealing His law to Cain, making it clear to him that this was a line never to be crossed, even though it is not until Noah that we see the law against murder cut in covenant. Nevertheless, we see Cain here in a sort of self-deception. He goes out into a field with his brother to have a conversation, but no words are actually spoken. He just wanted to talk to his brother, and it happened to be in a place with no witnesses. They were just going to talk. (He swears!) And God tells him, “No, talk to him here, in the house, in community. Dare to be vulnerable with him, to tell him you are angry and depressed. To hear him and his story and his struggles. Can you be strong enough to learn from your younger brother? Can you dare to see this obstacle, this immense problem in your life as a human?”</p><p>I think this story is like the one before it, except that it’s showing what happens when brokenness isn’t repaired. Adam and Eve came back together and were stronger than ever. Cain and Abel could never be reconciled in this world. Again, we see mistrust as the beating heart of all darkness — the belief that God is not good, and definitely not on your side. But now we see for the first time the true ugliness of sin and hear for the first time the true horror of the cry of an innocent victim’s blood.</p><p>And while we can see two radical sides to this story — God’s invitation to rejoin the story, and the fallout of their refusal of that invitation — the conclusion of this story is profound.</p><p>Two things are very clear. First, the story ends with new hope. There are always new ways to find hope, new bearers of God’s name, new faces which can lift others up. But what is most striking to me comes before that, when God punishes Cain. God casts Cain out of community, out of his inherited purpose, and Cain protests that it is too much, and brings up two issues God did not mention in his punishment: that he would be hidden from God’s face, and that he would be killed. Cain is scared. He is scared he will be separated from God and that he is going to die. And God responds to this murderer that He will personally protect him, that He will personally watch over him. Even though we don’t necessarily see any repentance or desire to reenter community or the story, we still see grace upon grace, unconditional love, a God who would both protect and avenge a murderer. A God who is willing to live out His story even when we are not. A God who walks with Cain in his wandering.</p></blockquote>'

				remarks: '<p>Can we talk about guilt, shame, and conviction? No, really, can we talk about them honestly, without fear? When it comes to each of our personal journeys, these realities seem to be what define our mental and emotional health.</p><p>Is shame a good thing or a bad thing? Is it the same thing as guilt? And how does conviction relate to all of this? The Holy Spirit, we are told in the New Testament, “convicts” us of sin. Is that just another way of saying the Holy Spirit makes us feel guilty or ashamed? The point is, if I do something really stupid and destructive, I should feel bad, right? But is that guilt or shame or conviction?</p><p>To start clearing up this confusion, we should probably recognize there are many ways to define these words and talk about them. There is a psychological perspective, a secular perspective, a theological perspective. We are, of course, having this conversation from a theological point of view; that is, what are guilt and shame and conviction all about as God sees them?</p><p>First, there is the reality of guilt. It’s true that this word in our western world primarily has legal connotations — after all, court verdicts in America are rendered one of two ways: “guilty” or “not guilty” — but the word is also conveying something much bigger than that. We all live by standards, whether our own, our parents’, a mentor’s, or God’s standards. But we all have them. And the thing is, no matter which standard we might use, sooner or later we all fall short of that standard. I am not the husband, the father, or the Jesus-follower I want to be. One of the terms for this shortfall that we find throughout the Bible is “sin.” To put it theologically, guilt is our experience of our own sin once we have been made aware of it. Guilt is what we feel when we realize we have acted as less than what we want to be and who we were created to be.</p><p>In last week’s discussion, Cain fell short in his offering. He fell short of whatever standard God was using, as well as of whatever standard he had set up for himself. When Cain realized this, his face fell and he experienced guilt. This led to greater sin: the murder of his brother. After he killed Abel, Cain’s guilt became even more pronounced. Cain was guilty and there is no softening of that reality — for him or for us.</p><p>But then there is shame. Shame is when a person begins to find their identity in their guilt. While guilt is the pronounced and undeniable reality, it does not undo the fundamental identity we were given at the beginning of the story. Even though our sin can be very destructive, the badness cannot undo all of the inherent goodness that abounds throughout creation.</p><p>Yet our guilt does seek to define us. It strives to give us a new name and a new identity, one defined by our worst mistakes. If we let it, guilt becomes shame. This was true for Adam and Eve.</p><blockquote class="blockquote--scripture">Then the eyes of both of them were opened, and they realized they were naked; so they sewed fig leaves together and made coverings for themselves. (Gen. 3, NIV)</blockquote><p>Once they knew their guilt, they hid themselves and entered into shame.</p><p>God went for a walk and was searching for Adam and Eve. “Where are you?” I love the questions God asks, because they are rarely the ones I would expect. (Shouldn’t the omniscient God know where they are?)</p><p>They tell God they were afraid of Him because of their nakedness, so they hid. What would you expect God to say at this point? He will never ask, “How could you?” He will ask, however, “What have you done?” But even that is not His first question in this world where hiding is suddenly a grim reality. No, God asks, “Who told you that you were naked?”</p><p>In other words, “What other voices have you been listening to? What other voices have you allowed to define you? Who told you that the way I created you was bad?” God made them naked and it was good — but then for them, it wasn’t. They were guilty, without question, but they had been renamed by their guilt. Shame had redefined their identity.</p><p>What should they have done? What should we do when mired in shame?</p><p>Trust the story.</p><p>If you trust that your identity is found in God’s love and design and acceptance of you, then you allow yourself to look at your guilt square in the face and see it for what it is. You do not downplay its significance or run from the confrontation of it. You see it and you can accept it as yours. You can engage in the work of confession, repentance, and restitution. And then you move on, trusting the story. In 2 Corinthians, this is what Paul called “godly sorrow,” and it leads to salvation.</p><p>If you don’t trust the story, you never navigate your guilt in a healthy way. You downplay it, make excuses, or live in a state of denial and run from the need to deal with it. The other route through a failure to navigate guilt is shame and a false identity rooted in failures. This is what Paul called “worldly sorrow,” and it only ends in death.</p><p>But if you can navigate your guilt with faith [read: trust] in the promises of God, then you confront your guilt and you avoid shame by the grace of God. You are then able to walk in the truth of conviction. This journey through life enables you to grow, develop, and evolve spiritually because of this experience. It is in this space that the conviction of the Holy Spirit enables us to become (and continue becoming) a new creation. It is this space that enables us to know where we have been and use it to take us forward to better experiences.</p>'
