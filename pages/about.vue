					<p>
						‚ÄúBlessed is the man<br>
						who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,<br>
						nor stands in the way of sinners,<br>
						nor sits in the seat of scoffers;<br>
						but his delight is in the law of the LORD,<br>
						and on his law he meditates day and night.<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						He is like a tree<br>
						planted by streams of water<br>
						that yields its fruit in its season,<br>
						and its leaf does not wither.<br>
						In all that he does, he prospers.<br>
						The wicked are not so,<br>
						but are like chaff that the wind drives away.‚Äù
