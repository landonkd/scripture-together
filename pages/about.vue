					<p>
						‚ÄúBlessed is the man<br>who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,<br>
						nor stands in the way of sinners,<br>
						nor sits in the seat of scoffers;<br>
						but his delight is in the law of the LORD,<br>
						and on his law he meditates day and night.<br>
					</p>
					<p>
						He is like a tree<br>
						planted by streams of water<br>
						that yields its fruit in its season,<br>
						and its leaf does not wither.<br>
						In all that he does, he prospers.<br>
						The wicked are not so,<br>
						but are like chaff that the wind drives away.‚Äù

The end of each month includes days to catch up on missed reading, mediate and study deeper on passages that impacted you, or prepare for and study the background for next month's reading. Scripture references are in the ESV.</p>
